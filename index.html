            <p>System.css is a CSS library for building interfaces that resemble Apple's System OS which ran from 1984-1991. Design-wise, not much really changed from System 1 to System 6; however this library is based on System 6 as it was the final monochrome version of MacOS.</p>

            <p>Fortunately, this library does not use any JavaScript and is compatible with any front-end framework of your choice. Most styles can also be overwritten to allow for deeper customization.</p>
